# Ant-Sized Adventure

Dive into a new adventure!

_A mad scientist accidentally shrinks you to the size of an ant._

🐜 Use your miniature size to your advantage as you save the world!

**See the world from a totally different perspective!**

You are no longer the privileged player who has to shape the Minecraft world, but you will be transformed into a small part of it.
